# 👋 Hey there, I'm Abhishek!

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I’m a curious mind passionate about **DevOps**, **cloud technologies**, and building scalable systems that make a difference.

## 👨‍💻 What I Do

I'm currently working as a **Senior Cloud Engineer** with a focus on:
- 🚀 Kubernetes & container orchestration
- ☁️ Azure Cloud infrastructure
- 🔄 CI/CD pipelines & GitOps
- 🧩 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm)
- 🛠️ Automation & performance tuning

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- Become a certified **Azure Solutions Architect**
- Emplore **Golang** in depth
- Achieve **Kubestronaut** status (all K8s certs!)
- Contribute to open-source DevOps tooling

## 🧠 Learning Mindset

I believe in continuous learning and enjoy solving problems that stretch my comfort zone. Whether it’s deploying an application with complex requirements or doing RnD for a monitoring tool — I’m in!

## ☕ Outside of Work

When I’m not diving into cloud tech, you’ll find me:
- 🏏 Playing Cricket
- 🎧 Vibing to music or podcasts
- 🏏 Playing PC games
- 🗺️ Planning my next short adventure
